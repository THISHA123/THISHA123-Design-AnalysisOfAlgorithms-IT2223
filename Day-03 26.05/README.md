📁 *BubbleSortDemo.m*
-Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array.

-Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

-Compares adjacent elements and swaps if out of order.

-Time complexity: O(n²)

Outputs the sorted array.

📁 *InsertionSortDemo.m*
-Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm for sorting an array.

-Input: [5, 4, 10, 1, 6, 2]

-Inserts each element into its correct position by shifting larger elements.

-Time complexity: O(n²) worst case, O(n) best case.

-Outputs the sorted array.
