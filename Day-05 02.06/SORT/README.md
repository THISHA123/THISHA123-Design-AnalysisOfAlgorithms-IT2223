Merge Sort & Quick Sort
This document includes two popular sorting algorithm implementations in MATLAB: Merge Sort and Quick Sort. Both algorithms are recursive and used to sort arrays in ascending order.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Merge Sort
Merge Sort follows the Divide and Conquer strategy by dividing the array into halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging them

ðŸ”¹ 2. Quick Sort
Quick Sort also uses the Divide and Conquer approach. It selects a pivot, partitions the array into elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.
