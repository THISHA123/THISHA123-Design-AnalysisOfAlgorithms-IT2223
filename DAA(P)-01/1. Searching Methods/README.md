🔍 BinarySearch.m
Implements the Binary Search algorithm.

Efficient for sorted arrays using divide-and-conquer.

Returns the index of the target if found.

Faster than linear search (Time complexity: O(log n)).

🔎 LinearSearchSimple.m
Performs a Linear Search on an array.

Checks each element until the target is found.

Suitable for unsorted arrays.

Simple and easy to understand (Time complexity: O(n)).

📁 CompareSearchAlgorithms.m
* Compares Linear Search and Binary Search for finding a target in an array.

* Searches for the number 400 in an array from 1 to 1000.

* Measures and displays execution time for both algorithms.

* Shows which method is more efficient for large datasets.
