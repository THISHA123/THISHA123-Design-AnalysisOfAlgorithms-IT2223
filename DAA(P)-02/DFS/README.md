# Depth-First Search (DFS) in MATLAB with Adjacency Matrix and Graph Plot

This MATLAB script performs **Depth-First Search (DFS)** traversal on the same graph using an **adjacency matrix**, and also visualizes the structure using MATLAB's plotting tools.

## ðŸ“Œ Graph Structure
          A
          |
          B
         / \
        /   \
       /      \ 
      C       D
    /
   /
  E

  
### ðŸ”— Edges
- Aâ€“B  
- Bâ€“C  
- Bâ€“D  
- Câ€“E

## ðŸ§  Features

- Graph represented with an adjacency matrix.
- DFS traversal implemented recursively.
- Graph visualized using `graph()` and `plot()`.
- Traversal starts at node `A` and prints visited order.

## âœ… Output Example
DFS Traversal: A B C E D
