Graph
1. Write the MATLAB code to import a graph. use the following source and destination data.

2. Using the import data, draw the Graph

3. write the MATLAB code to find and display the subgraph for the given nodes.

4. identify and display the adjacent vertices each node.

5.lable edges of the graph.

6. label nodes of the graph.

7. write the MATLAB code to color the graph(graph coloring)

8. write the MATLAB code to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5

source=[1,1,2,3,4];
destination=[2,3,4,4,5];
