ðŸ“Š SimpleTreeGraph: Visualizing Directed Tree Structures in MATLAB
This repository provides two MATLAB scripts to model, plot, and explore simple directed trees using digraph. These scripts demonstrate graph construction with named nodes, layered layouts, edge labeling, coloring, and weighted edge analysis.

ðŸ”§ Files
SimpleTreeGraph.m
Builds a directed tree with 7 named nodes (A through G)

Visualizes the structure using a layered layout

Labels nodes and arranges the graph in a top-down tree format

SimpleTreeGraphweight.m
Extends the tree model by adding weighted edges

Displays edge weights directly on the graph

Useful for visualizing hierarchical structures with associated costs or metrics
